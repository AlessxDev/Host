# messages.yml - editable language file for LobbySpawn
# - Each entry has:
#     enabled: true|false  -> whether the message is sent at all
#     text: "<message>"    -> the message text (use & color codes, e.g. &a)
# - Edit texts or disable messages here. Placeholders are NOT implemented by default,
#   but notes include suggested placeholders you could add later (eg. {world}, {x}, etc.)
